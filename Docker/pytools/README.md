### Files for docker-compose:

To interact with the pytools image it is recommended to use the docker compose file and configure some aliases:

- For Linux use the file: [pytools_linux.yml](https://github.com/Seebak-Tech/DevTools/blob/0ab46d6e7c3b87c8722b83df557514c40d3e9238/Docker/pytools/pytools_linux.yml)
      
    
- For MacOs use the file: [pytools_mac.yml](https://github.com/Seebak-Tech/DevTools/blob/0ab46d6e7c3b87c8722b83df557514c40d3e9238/Docker/pytools/pytools_mac.yml)

Only for work with x11-apps in MacOS add: 
 
      echo 'export HOST_DOCKER="host.docker.internal"' >> ~/.zshrc 

### Test

For run your workspace you have to define environment variable WORKSPACE to point to the path where your proyect repository is located and follow the next steps:

### Run with Docker-compose

You can build, run, up, down, start, stop, pause and unpause the container adding the following alias to the .zshrc file:

    alias pytools-ssh="ssh admin@localhost -p 22 -t tmux a"
    
    alias pytools-up="docker-compose -f $WORKSPACE/pytools_***.yml up -d"

    alias pytools-down="docker-compose -f $WORKSPACE/pytools_***.yml down"
    
    alias pytools-start="docker-compose -f $WORKSPACE/pytools_***.yml start"
    
    alias pytools-stop="docker-compose -f $WORKSPACE/pytools_***.yml stop"

    alias pytools-pause="docker-compose -f $WORKSPACE/pytools_***.yml pause"
  
    alias pytools-unpause="docker-compose -f $WORKSPACE/pytools_***.yml unpause"
 

### Or you can use your own docker-compose file:

    Usage:
      docker-compose [-f <arg>...] [COMMAND]  [options]

    Options:
      -f, --file FILE             Specify an alternate compose file
                                  (default: docker-compose.yml)
    Commands:
      down               Stop and remove containers, networks, images, and volumes
      pause              Pause services
      start              Start services
      stop               Stop services
      unpause            Unpause services
      up                 Create and start containers

You can also see this information and more by running docker-compose --help from the command line.

### Example 

 In the next example we connect to the container using the alias previously configured:
        
    pytools-ssh
    admin@localhost's password:

### Credentials:

      User: admin
      Default password: admin1
